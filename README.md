# \[Sonic Signatures of Paramore: A Multi-Modal Analysis of Audio, Notation, and Metadata\]
<!-- Version 1.0 -->
Task 2: The central theme for this dataset is the American rock band Paramore, focusing on their musical evolution across albums and producers. The dataset will include three types of data: musical scores (transcribed sections capturing rhythm, pitch, and harmony), metadata (album, year, genre, composer, producer, licensing), and audio recordings (studio tracks in WAV or MP3 format). By combining these modalities, this dataset enables an analysis of Paramore’s signature sound, how it varies across albums, and how production and compositional decisions interact to create the band’s characteristic style.

Task 3: Music data presents several challenges, including issues with access, curation, and consistency. High-quality recordings are often commercially restricted, making it difficult to acquire audio for analysis. Notated music may be unavailable or exist in inconsistent formats, requiring transcription. Metadata is often incomplete or inconsistent across sources, and musical characteristics like timbre or harmonic style are qualitative, requiring computational proxies such as MFCCs, chromagrams, or spectrograms. Additionally, organizing audio, notation, and metadata into a coherent dataset can be technically demanding, particularly when analyzing multiple albums and production contexts. 
Paramore exemplifies many of these challenges. Early albums such as All We Know Is Falling or Riot! are harder to access in high-quality audio for analysis. Sheet music is often limited or unofficial, requiring careful transcription from recordings. Metadata across discographies, Wikipedia, and music databases can be inconsistent, necessitating standardization. Moreover, capturing Paramore’s “sound” requires integrating audio feature extraction, notation analysis, and metadata, all while accounting for stylistic changes across albums and producers. These challenges illustrate the complexity of curating a multi-modal dataset for a modern rock band.
Paramore data currently exists in multiple forms. Studio recordings and live performances are available through commercial releases and streaming platforms, though often without detailed technical metadata. Limited sheet music is available, requiring transcription for analysis. Metadata can be sourced from album liner notes, discographies, and online databases such as MusicBrainz, AllMusic, or Wikipedia. Audio can be analyzed using tools like SonicVisualizer and Python libraries (librosa, music21), while notation can be encoded in MuseScore, MusicXML, or MEI. Combining these forms allows researchers to study rhythm, pitch, timbre, harmonic structure, and production characteristics across the band’s discography.
