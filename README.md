# \[Week 1: Musical Datasets\]
<!-- Version 1.0 -->
The theme of my dataset is the English rock band Wolf Alice. The band currently consists of four members: front-woman and guitarist Ellie Rowsell, guitarist Joff Oddie, bassist Theo Ellis, and drummer Joel Amey. Formed in Northern London, Wolf Alice began as an acoustic duo featuring Rowsell and Oddie, but later evolved into a full rock-oriented band. They released their first EP, My Love Is Cool, on June 22nd, 2015, and their music have since become known for blending genres such as indie rock, dream pop, and shoegaze, often exploring themes of nostalgia, memory, and reflection on the past. I chose Wolf Alice as my dataset theme because I am particularly interested in how their music conveys emotional storytelling through melody, harmony. I am a huge fan of their music and familiar with their work, which I believe will help me complete the subsequent analysis tasks more effectively.

## Current Manifestations of Data Relating to My Theme
### Descriptive data
Information about Wolf Alice and their albums can be found on their official website and streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. This includes album names, release dates, track listings, genre tags, band members, and some production credits. Much of the detailed metadata—like harmonic structure or instrumentation nuances—is stored in proprietary formats and not directly visible, which makes systematic collection a challenge.

### Notated data
Sheet music for Wolf Alice songs is limited, so custom transcriptions are often necessary. Notated data varies across sources, making standardization important for analysis. MusicXML and MEI formats are useful for encoding musical structure consistently.

### Acoustic data
Studio recordings, live performances, and fan uploads provide a variety of acoustic data. Audio analysis can examine features such as timbre, harmony, and texture across tracks that exemplify the band’s sound.

### Challenges
Working with Wolf Alice illustrates common challenges in music data: access is limited for some metadata and sheet music, standardization is inconsistent across sources, and multiple versions of recordings complicate analysis. Collecting, curating, and organizing descriptive, notated, and acoustic data is essential to create a dataset suitable for meaningful analysis.
