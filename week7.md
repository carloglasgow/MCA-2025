# [Week 7: Curration Challenges]
## Task 1: Updating last week's metadata
I updated the MEI encoding for "Bros" to enhance its metadata for academic use. The update involved two key additions: a <notesStmt> element to classify the song's genre as "Indie Rock" and "Dream Pop," and a revised <availability> section that properly credits the original publisher (Kobalt Music Publishing) while applying a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license to my own encoding work. These changes bring the file in line with digital musicology standards, making the encoding a clearer, more reusable scholarly resource that distinguishes between the original copyrighted work and my derivative analysis. <br>
You can see the updated MEI file, <a href= "Bros-modified(v2).mei" target="_blank">here</a>
