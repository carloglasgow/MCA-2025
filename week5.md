-<b>Source</b>: Not specified, but the encoding was an automated "Transcode from MusicXML."<br>
-<b>Size</b>: Physical file size is not available in the XML metadata.<br>
-<b>Publisher</b>: Kobalt Music Publishing Limited<br>
-<b>Date</b>: Encoding date is 2025-12-09<br>
-<b>Usage Restrictions</b>: The <availability> tag states "End of Preview," indicating this is likely a sample or preview file with distribution restrictions, not the full work.<br>

### Metadata about the encoding process:
-<b>Editorial Changes</b>: The file was automatically transcoded from MusicXML by the software Verovio. No manual editorial changes are documented in this header.<br>
