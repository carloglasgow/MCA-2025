# [Week 3: Encoding Notated Music]
<!-- Version 1.0 -->
## Task 1: Generating MusicXML and MEI files 
The first part of this week’s task involved exporting my MuseScore file to a MusicXML format, and then converting it into an MEI file. These formats allow for more detailed and semantically rich representations of the music, which will be useful for later analysis and rendering. Both files can be accessed through the links below: 

Download the <a href="Bros.musicxml" target="_blank">MusicXML file</a><br>
Download the <a href="Bros.mei" target="_blank">MEI file</a> 

## Task 2: Rendering the MEI file using Verovio 
For the second part of the task, I used the Verovio toolkit to render my MEI file directly on this website. I copied the code from the verovio.html template and edited it as needed to display the score properly. 

### If the Verovio app is not loading correctly, please refresh the page to ensure the score displays

{% include_relative verovio_inline.html %}
